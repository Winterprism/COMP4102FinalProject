Description: Calculates the distance between objects through each object's center point and identifies circular and rectangular objects

To run the program:
    - Get all required libraries at the top of "distCalc.py"
    - Open a terminal in Python and run "python distCalc.py --image example_01.png --width 0.955"
    - Replace "example_01.png" with the desired image to test
    - Replace "--width 0.955" with desired width/diameter for the left-most image
